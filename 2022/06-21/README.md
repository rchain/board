## Resolution: Special Meeting Ballot

On a motion proposed by Steve Ross-Talbot and seconded by Greg Meredith, it was moved to hold a special meeting ballot on the following 3 topics:

#### 1. Validator Reward Mint Policy (IoB 2022-01)
RChain mainnet is moving towards decentralization and needs 3rd party validators and all REV holders to help secure the network.  The membership resolves that RChain Cooperative mint all validator rewards.  Minting will be on an asymptotic schedule similar to Bitcoin. The total validator rewards minted will not exceed 100M REV over the life of the protocol.
(See supporting document.)

#### 2. Unburning REV Tokens (IoB 2022-02)
The membership resolves that RChain Cooperative (proportionally) unburn 129,336,426 REV upon closing a $30M investment.  The unburned REV will return the total token supply to 1 billion REV.

Commentary:

Taken together these two IoBs will take the total supply from 0.870663574B to 1.1B fixed supply.  This is a percentage increase of 10% of the total token supply.

#### 3. Converting Cooperative to Limited Cooperative Association (LCA) (IoB 2022-03)
The membership resolves that RChain Cooperative converts from a Washington State Cooperative to a Washington State Limited Cooperative Association (LCA).

The motion (Special Meeting Ballot) carries.

Ayes: Lucius Gregory Meredith, Darryl Neudorf, Steve Henley, Theo Hallenius, Steve Ross-Talbot, Shixi Lin \
Abstaining: none \
Not present: Eric Meng, Camila Salkov, Rao Bhamidipati
