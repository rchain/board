## Resolution 1: 3rd-party service provider accounts
On a motion proposed by Ting Yang and seconded by Jim Whitescarver the Co-op’s former systems admin is authorized to administer Co-op accounts to which he has access so that he can curtail these services from further billing the Co-op.

Ayes: Steve Henley, Theo Hallenius, Rao Bhamidipati, Darryl Neudorf, Jim Whitescarver, Ting Yang, Camila Salkov (by proxy to Rao) \
Abstaining: none \
Not present: Camila Salkov has proxied her vote to Rao Bhamidipati

## Resolution 2: Dissolution of RChain Cooperative (UBI # 604 086 304)
Whereas the Co-op’s known liabilities (approx. $1.3 million) far exceed its known assets ($7.81) because of the actions of the former President Lucius Gregory Meredith against the expressed instructions of board members; 

Whereas the Board does not know the full extent of liabilities because it’s not clear how many more liabilities Mr. Meredith may have created without the knowledge of the board (board did not have visibility and knowledge of signed contracts beyond some employee and contractor contracts);

Whereas Mr. Meredith canceled the co-op bank accounts rather than provide proper transition to the board, making the near-term operations of the co-op extremely difficult if not impossible;

Whereas Mr. Meredith’s actions foreclosed any possibility of fundraising from the members;

Whereas the Secretary-Treasurer submitted to the board that instead of proper transfer of digital assets including the staking wallet resources that belong to co-op members, Mr. Meredith sent what appear to be undecipherable binary files without instructions;

Whereas the Board was unable to find a (statutorily required) President willing to work for the co-op under these circumstances and without salary;

On a motion proposed by Darryl Neudorf and seconded by Steve Henley, it was moved by the board to terminate any remaining employees, cancel all active contracts, and let the Washington State Attorney General take the necessary next steps including appropriately distributing the available assets (currently in possession of Mr. Meredith) to creditors and members, and dissolving the cooperative.


Ayes: Darryl Neudorf, Steve Henley, Theo Hallenius, Rao Bhamidipati, Jim Whitescarver, Ting Yang, Camila Salkov (by proxy to Rao) \
Abstaining: none \
Not present: Camila Salkov has proxied her vote to Rao Bhamidipati

## Resolution 3: Resignation of all Board Members and Officers
On a motion proposed by Theo Hallenius and seconded by Steve Henley, it was moved by the board to accept the resignations of the following Board Members and co-op officers and authorize Rao Bhamidipati to submit an amended annual notice to the Washington Secretary of State to officially record these resignations.

Jim Whitescarver as Board member and interim Secretary-Treasurer
Ting Yang as Board member 
Rao Bhamidipati as Board Member
Steve Henley as Board member
Theo Hallenius as Board member
