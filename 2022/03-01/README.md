## Resolution: DAASL Support
On a motion by Greg Meredith, and seconded by Steve Henley, it was moved that DAASL create a support contract with RChain Cooperative 
whereby 20% of the total DAASL token supply goes to RChain Cooperative for support.  Of RChain Cooperative’s 20%, RChain Cooperative 
will retain 10% of the tokens and REV holders will receive 10% of the tokens as an airdrop.

Of the remaining 80% of total tokens and 100% equity, DAASL key stakeholders will receive 3% equity shares and 5% of the total token 
supply, which will be issued on a predetermined vesting schedule.
Of the 75% remaining tokens,  in the event of an equity sale, RChain Cooperative will receive 50% of the DAASL remaining token supply 
in exchange for ⅗ of the remaining 97% DAASL equity shares.

After the DAASL fundraising event 17.5% of received investments, either equity or token, (up to $2.625M) will go to RChain Cooperative 
as a support contract and finder’s fee.

The motion carries.
