## Resolution: Revise Special Meeting Ballot

On a motion proposed by Shixi Lin and seconded by Greg Meredith, it was moved to revise the July 3-4, 2022 ballot to the following:

#### 1. Validator Reward Mint Policy (IoB 2022-01)
RChain mainnet is moving towards decentralization and needs 3rd party validators and all REV holders to help secure the network. 
The membership resolves that RChain Cooperative mint all validator rewards. Minting will be on an asymptotic schedule similar to 
Bitcoin. The total validator rewards minted will not exceed 100M REV over the life of the protocol.
(See supporting [illustration](TotalValidatorReward.JPG) of the asymptotic curve)

#### 2. Unburning REV Tokens (IoB 2022-02)
The membership resolves that upon the sale of 60M REV the Coop will unburn the [tokens](https://revdefine.io/#/revaccounts/1111dmyT6TSbyVRGx98srm5dbhQxzduoTAK3DNPSXM4swUBu9QgiV) that burned at the outset of the project. 
The unburned REV will return the total token supply to 1 billion REV.

<br>

**Commentary**:

IOB 2 returns the token supply to its original intended value of 1B tokens.  IOB 1 makes sure that the validator/staking rewards do not consume the entire token supply, but also keeps a limit on the amount that can be minted, ensuring that validator/staking rewards do not exceed 100M tokens over the lifetime of the protocol. 

We will defer IOB 3 (Converting RChain Cooperative to a Limited Cooperative Association) to the annual general meeting (AGM) in October 2022.

The motion (Revise Special Meeting Ballot) carried unamimously.

Ayes: Lucius Gregory Meredith, Steve Henley, Theo Hallenius, Shixi Lin, Darryl Neudorf, Rao Bhamidipati \
Abstaining: none \
Not present: Steve Ross-Talbot, Camila Salkov, Eric Meng

## Resolution: Registration Fee Discounts
On a motion proposed by Greg Meredith and seconded by Rao Bhamidipati, it was moved to authorize the Co-op president to approve registration fee discounts for specific candidates.

The motion carried unanimously.

Ayes: Lucius Gregory Meredith, Steve Henley, Theo Hallenius, Shixi Lin, Darryl Neudorf, Rao Bhamidipati \
Abstaining: none \
Not present: Steve Ross-Talbot, Camila Salkov, Eric Meng
